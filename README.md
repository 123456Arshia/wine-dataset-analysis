## Description

Dive into the art of data analysis with this project, which revolves around the analysis and classification of wine data. The `wine_analysis_notebook.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook takes you through the entire process, step by step. It covers data preprocessing, visualization, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), training a Random Forest classifier, and evaluating its performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/123456Arshia/wine-dataset-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wine-dataset-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `wine_analysis_notebook.ipynb`:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell. Experience data visualization, PCA transformation, classifier training, and performance evaluation right within the notebook.

## Steps and Insights

- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the Wine dataset for analysis by loading, exploring, and cleaning the data.

- **Feature Standardization:** Standardize the features to ensure fair comparisons and optimal model performance.

- **Visual Exploration:** Visualize the distribution of wine types to gain initial insights.

- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Implement PCA to reduce the data's dimensionality while preserving key information.

- **Visualization of Reduced Dimensions:** Create scatter plots that reveal patterns in the reduced-dimensional space.

- **Random Forest Classification:** Train a Random Forest classifier on the PCA-transformed data.

- **Classifier Evaluation:** Evaluate the classifier's performance using accuracy metrics and classification reports.
