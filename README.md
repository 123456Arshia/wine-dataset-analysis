# Wine Dataset Analysis and Classification
This project showcases an example of data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and classification using the Wine dataset. The script provided in this repository loads the Wine dataset, preprocesses the data, performs dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and trains a Random Forest classifier for wine type classification.


This project showcases an example of data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and classification using the Wine dataset. The script provided in this repository loads the Wine dataset, preprocesses the data, performs dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and trains a Random Forest classifier for wine type classification.

The Wine dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of features related to the chemical composition of different types of wines. The script demonstrates how to preprocess the dataset, visualize its distribution, and use PCA for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. Additionally, a Random Forest classifier is trained to predict the wine type based on the reduced-dimensional data.

The main steps performed by the script include data loading, preprocessing, visualization, PCA, and classification. The results are displayed through visualizations and evaluation metrics.

This project serves as an educational example for individuals interested in applying linear algebra concepts to real-world data analysis and classification tasks.

## Overview

The provided Python script performs various tasks related to data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and classification on the Wine dataset. The script uses libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to achieve the following:

1. Load the Wine dataset, preprocess the data, and save it to a CSV file.
2. Standardize the features of the dataset using the StandardScaler.
3. Visualize the distribution of different wine types.
4. Split the data into training and test sets.
5. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
6. Visualize the data in reduced dimensions using scatter plots.
7. Train a Random Forest classifier on the PCA-transformed data and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/123456Arshia/wine-dataset-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd wine-dataset-analysis
```

3. Run the provided Python script:

```bash
python wine_analysis_script.py
```

The script will perform data analysis, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and classification on the Wine dataset. It will display visualizations and print evaluation metrics for the trained classifier.

## Description of Steps

The script `wine_analysis_script.py` performs the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries:** Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. **Loading and Preprocessing Data:** Load the Wine dataset, preprocess it, and save the processed data to a CSV file.

3. **Standardization:** Standardize the features of the dataset using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

4. **Data Visualization:** Visualize the distribution of different wine types using a bar plot.

5. **Data Splitting:** Split the data into training and test sets using the train_test_split function.

6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Perform PCA on the training data to reduce dimensionality.

7. **PCA Visualization:** Create scatter plots to visualize the data in reduced dimensions.

8. **Random Forest Classifier:** Train a Random Forest classifier on the PCA-transformed training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.

9. **Visualization with Class Separation:** Create scatter plots with lines separating classes based on wine type.

## Results

The script generates visualizations that help you understand the distribution of wine types and the separation achieved through PCA. It also provides information about the accuracy and classification report of the trained Random Forest classifier on the test data.
